# Preamble ---

Initiate script

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) # clear workspace
options(scipen = 999) # disable scientific notation
tmst <- paste("", format(Sys.time(), "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")) # get current timestamp
font_fam <- names(pdfFonts())[10] # set font family
```

Load packages

```{r, message = FALSE}
# library(magrittr)
# library(dplyr)
# library(ggplot2)
```

# Sequences ---

## The `seq()` function

The simplest data we can generate is a sequence. In an *arithmetic sequence* we have a series of numbers where the difference from any succeeding term to its preceding term remains constant. To generate such a sequence, we need to know where it starts, where it ends, and what the increment is:

```{r}
seq(from = 2, to = 5, by = 0.5)
```

We can also reverse the order; in this case we need to make sure we use a negative increment:

```{r}
seq(from = 5, to = 2, by = -0.5)
```

If the direction and the increment sign are inconsistent, we will get an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
seq(from = 2, to = 5, by = -0.5)
```

The above sequence (from = 2, to = 5, by = 0.5) has 7 numbers; we could calculate this as:

```{r}
(5 - 2)/0.5 + 1
```

Why the `+1` in the calculation? Because, in order to construct `N` intervals, we need to have `N+1` numbers. To construct a chest of 3 drawers, we need to have 4 horizontal wood sheets.

Sometimes, it's important to control the length of the sequence, because the number of generated terms is definite. In that case, we can work out the math and calculate the increment. If we need 6 numbers from 3.3 to 9.1, we would have to run the following:

```{r}
seq(from = 3.3, to = 9.1, by = (9.1 - 3.3)/(6 - 1))
```

Notice the `- 1` because now we are converting the length to an increment. Since it would be quite risky to rely on manual calculations, the `seq()` function offers a direct alternative, where we can simply provide the desired length of the sequence.

```{r}
seq(from = 3.3, to = 9.1, length.out = 6)
```

Finally, there is a way to get the desired length from an existing vector in that case we replace the `length.out` with `along.with`. This will save us from calculating the length ourselves.

```{r}
nms <- c("Helen", "George", "Nick")
seq(from = 0.23, to = 0.55, along.with = nms)
```

```{r}
seq(from = 9.1, to = 3.3, length.out = 6)
```

### The Uniform distribution

Suppose we want to generate random numbers between a minimum and a maximum value. In this case, it suffices to have a mechanism that generates random numbers between 0 and 1. The function `runif` (where "r" is for "random" and "unif" for "uniform") is doing that:

```{r}
x <- runif(n = 7)
x
```

If we wanted to obtain numbers between min = 3.3 and max = 9.1, we perform the calculation:

```{r}
(9.1 - 3.3) * x + 3.3
```

Let's plot a large number of such numbers, to see their distribution:

```{r}
y <- (9.1 - 3.3) * runif(1e5) + 3.3
hist(y, breaks = seq(3.3, 9.1, length.out = 10))
```

`runif()` saves us from having to perform the calculation, as it takes a `min` and a `max` option:

```{r}
runif(n = 7, min = 3.3, max = 9.1)
```

```{r}
x <- (35 - 15) * rweibull(n = 20, shape = 1.5, scale = 1.0) + 10
summary(x)
```

```{r}
density(x)
```

```{r}
# x*ecdf(x)
```



```{r}
DF <- matrix(0, nrow = 20, ncol = 5)
DF <- as.data.frame(DF)
names(DF) <- c("ID", "Name", "Age", "Income", "BMI")
DF
```

```{r}
formatC(1:10, width = 3, format = "d", flag = "0")
```

width = 3 creates numbers with 3 digits, format = "d" creates integers, and flag = "0" pads leading zeros.
